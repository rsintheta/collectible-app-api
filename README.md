# collectible-app-api
This was an extremely fun project where I built a more sophisticated API that
included testing.

Many thanks to Mark Winterbottom for answering some of the questions I had
when I was setting this up.
Please note that the use of any names(of people, projects or products) during
testing is by no means any form of endorsement. All numbers were selected
via a randomizer, and any numerical symbolism you may infer from them is
purely coincidental and unintentional.
